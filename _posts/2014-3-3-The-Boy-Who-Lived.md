title: Chapter 1 - The Boy Who Lived
---

The story opens with the Dursley family: Vernon, Petunia, and their son Dudley, who live at number four, Privet Drive. They are an ordinary family in a perfectly normal neighborhood. Vernon Dursley notices strange occurrences during his day, such as people in cloaks celebrating and mentioning someone named Harry.

That night, a mysterious figure named Albus Dumbledore appears on Privet Drive, followed by a stern-looking woman named Professor McGonagall, who transforms from a cat into her human form. They discuss the fall of the dark wizard Voldemort and the fate of the Potter family. It is revealed that Voldemort killed Harry Potter's parents, but when he tried to kill baby Harry, the curse backfired, leaving Harry with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.

Dumbledore tells McGonagall that Harry will be left with his only remaining family, the Dursleys, even though they are not the ideal guardians. Hagrid, a giant of a man, arrives on a flying motorcycle with baby Harry. Dumbledore leaves a letter for the Dursleys explaining everything. The three wizards leave Harry on the doorstep, and the chapter ends with Harry sleeping, unaware of his significance and the adventures that await him.
